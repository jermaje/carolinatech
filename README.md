## 💻 Getting Started

This is a static website, so no complex build tools, dependencies, or servers are required to run it locally.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in any modern web browser.
3. *Optional*: For the best development experience, open the folder in VS Code and use the **Live Server** extension to preview changes in real-time.

## 📝 Configuration (Web3Forms)

The contact form is configured to send emails using Web3Forms. The access key is assembled at runtime in the JavaScript file to prevent simple scraping.

To change the email destination, you need to update the Web3Forms access key:

1. Visit [web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com/) and enter your email address to get a free Access Key.
2. Open `assets/js/main.js` and locate the `initForm` function.
3. Find the `_k` array where the key is split into parts (to avoid scraper bots finding it easily):
   ```javascript
   // Change these string pieces to match your new access key separated by dashes
   const _k = ['your', 'new', 'access', 'key', 'here'];
   ```
4. Save the file. The form will now send submissions to your registered email address.
